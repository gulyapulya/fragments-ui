# fragments-ui
This repo is dedicated for the fragments-ui web app which was developed first during the second lab as part of the cloud computing course. It is used to teach us authorization and authentication, start using one of the AWS services under learner lab account and test the API created in the previous lab.

I am the only developer and contributor but this was created with the help of lab and course materials.
